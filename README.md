# SelfCleaningAcessories

Accessories for conducting surface self-cleaning tests.

It is recommended to use the open-source syringe pump project developed by Samorkhin for volumetric control of liquid during the test. More details about Samorkhin project can be found at: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4194094.

The accessories presented here can be 3D printed, aiding in the reproducibility of the surface self-cleaning tests. 
If you want to perform tests with a fixed tilt angle, the 45Â° sample support file (SuporteAmostraInc45) can be used. However, if you want to perform tests with a variable tilt angle, the authors recommend the use of the device developed by Woodcraft (https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Pan-Tilt-Goniometer/). The device created by Woodcraft allows both rotation and tilt of the sample along the plane perpendicular to the direction of the fall of the drop. In self-cleaning tests, there is no need to rotate the sample. Therefore, to save material, Centre_Section_Mod and Top_ModSection files can be used instead of the original ones, resulting in a device that allows control of the tilt angle only.

Th nozzle files (Bico_1mm and Bico_2mm) can be used to gather well-deformed drops. They allow the use of simple hoses in the conduction of surface self-cleaning tests. Their ends can be changes do conenct hoses of differente diameters.
